> **Good news! Secure Scuttlebutt's server, [Scuttlebot](https://github.com/ssbc/scuttlebot), is now available.**

> [Secure Scuttlebutt](https://github.com/ssbc/secure-scuttlebutt) is a P2P database protocol created by [Dominic Tarr](https://twitter.com/dominictarr).
It started as a small spec and a library which wrapped LevelDB.
A year ago I joined Dominic on the project, and today we're ready to release [Scuttlebot](https://github.com/ssbc/scuttlebot), a complete SSB server.

## Big Mission

**Our team goal is to create desktop applications that out-compete Web applications.**

Desktop applications have two qualities that the Web can't match:

 1. **Confidentiality.** Desktop applications don't emit user behavior to hosts, or depend on hosts to provide security.
 2. **Agency.** Desktop applications put business logic in the client, which allows users to control the most important behaviors of their software.

Not only are these qualities important for FOSS, they're important for expanding choice and protecting user's rights.
But, for desktop applications to really be *better* than Web apps, they have to solve a lot of shortcomings:

 - **Connectivity**, so they can network as effectively as Web applications do.
 - **Sandboxing**, so installing apps isn't a risk.
 - **Code-signing** and **Auditing**, so giving apps permissions isn't a risk.
 - **Cross-app-RPC**, so you can write apps that depend on each other.
 - **Orchestration**, so you don't task the user with configuration.
 - **Auto-updating**, so apps don't have to bother users with manual patching.

We're working on tools to solve each of these problems.


### Scuttlebot's Role in the Big Mission

Scuttlebot provides **Connectivity** without a host dependency.
It exchanges files and application-data with extensive crytographic signing, and can therefore satisfy **Code-signing** and **Auto-updating**.
And, it uses [libsodium](http://doc.libsodium.org/) to encrypt for end-to-end **Confidentiality**.

[Scuttlebot](https://github.com/ssbc/scuttlebot) is the first package we're releasing.
Let's look at the details.

## Secure Scuttlebutt

**Secure Scuttlebutt (SSB)** is a P2P database protocol of message-feeds.
It consists of

- Per-user append-only logs of messages (i.e. [kappa architecture](http://www.kappa-architecture.com/))
- Content-addressable storage (i.e. `obj.id == hash(obj)`)
- Message distribution over a [gossip network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gossip_protocol)

[Scuttlebot](https://github.com/ssbc/scuttlebot) is an SSB server.
It provides the SSB database, a networked blob-store, the gossip protocol, and a CLI and RPC interface.


### Data Structures

Intuitively, you can think of SSB as structured like Twitter.
All data is structured into _Feeds_, _Messages_, and _Blobs_.
A Message is a single post, and a Feed is an ordered log of messages.
A Blob is textual or binary data referenced in a message (similar to an email attachment).

Messages contain the ID of the feed they are in, the hash of the previous message, some arbitary JSON content (or an encrypted base64 string), and a signature.
Because each message is signed, anyone can verify that a given message belongs to a particular Feed.

### Links

Messages, feeds, and blobs are addressable by specially-formatted identifiers.
Message and blob IDs are content-hashes, while feed IDs are public keys.

To indicate the type of ID, a "sigil" is prepended to the string. They are:

 - `@` for feeds
 - `%` for messages
 - `&` for blobs

Additionally, each ID has a "tag" appended to indicate the hash or key algorithm.
Some example IDs:

 - A feed: `@LA9HYf5rnUJFHHTklKXLLRyrEytayjbFZRo76Aj/qKs=.ed25519`
 - A message: `%MPB9vxHO0pvi2ve2wh6Do05ZrV7P6ZjUQ+IEYnzLfTs=.sha256`
 - A blob: `&Pe5kTo/V/w4MToasp1IuyMrMcCkQwDOdyzbyD5fy4ac=.sha256`

When IDs are found in the messages, they are treated as links, with the keyname acting as a "relation" type.
SSB automatically builds an index based on these links, to allow queries such as "all messages with a `mentions` link to this user."


### Message Content

Messages and links in SSB are typed, but SSB doesn't try to impose any validation or schemas.
Each message is a simple JSON object:

```js
{
   type: 'post', // the only required field
   text: 'Hello, @alice!',
   mentions: [{
      link: '@hxGxqPrplLjRG2vtjQL87abX4QKqeLgCwQpS730nNwE=.ed25519',
      name: 'alice'
   }]
}
```

This is a `post`-type message with a `mentions`-type link.
Scuttlebot creates indexes on these types.
Interpretation and validation is left to the applications, per the [Kappa Architecture](http://www.kappa-architecture.com/).

Each user maintains a separate log, and each log is an ordered list of these messages.
Scuttlebot [provides an API](https://github.com/ssbc/docs/blob/master/intro-to-using-sbot.md) for querying and streaming these logs.

### Secure Gossip Networking

SSB is a [gossip network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gossip_protocol).
This means that information is able to distribute across multiple machines, without requiring direct connections between them.

![Gossip graph](/img/gossip-graph1.png)

Even though Alice and Dan lack a direct connection, they can still exchange feeds:

![Gossip graph 2](/img/gossip-graph2.png)

This is because gossip creates "transitive" connections between computers.
Dan's messages travel through Carla and the Pub to reach Alice, and visa-versa.
Because all feeds are signed, if Dan has confirmed Alice's pubkey, then Dan doesn't have to trust Carla *or* the Pub to receive Alice's messages from them.

"Pubs" are public nodes that help us get around [NAT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_address_translation) and the lack of IP addresses.
They aren't hosts, and have no special privileges, but they are often required to get global connectivity.
In a LAN, they're not needed.

### Consistency, Availability, Partition Tolerance

SecureScuttlebutt is designed for Availablitiy over Consistency,
each feed is internally ordered, but the order you receive messages
from other separate feeds is not determined. In most web 2.0 style
applications the order of events triggered by different users is not
important unless those users are interacting. I do not need to know about
your latest comments, upvotes, or selfies to post my own.

But, islands of consistency can be created, by posting a message
with a link to your message - since the link is the hash of your message, 
that's cryptographic proof that my message comes after yours.

SecureScuttlebutt is network of local ledgers, not a global ledger,
as in bitcoin, so it's not suitable for a cryptocurrency

with this you could implement collaborative editing or games or contracts
atop SecureScuttlebutt)

This is a drammaticly different behaviour to Proof of Work blockchains
like bitcoin. A global blockchain is mainly suitable for representing
financial transactions, but SecureScuttlebutt's network of chains
is much more suited to social networks, and applications built on such,
wikis, collaboration, discussion, games.

### Confidentiality

SecureScuttlebutt uses [private-box](https://github.com/auditdrivencrypto/private-box)
so you post private messages to your feed. To receive an encrypted
message, you attempt to decrypt every message you see, and you'll only
succeed if it was for you, this means other peers cannot see who is talking to who.
This does mean there must be a lot of attempted decryptions, but it is not
a big problem, because you'll only ever see the messages for your friends
and friends of friends.

SecureScuttlebutt uses [secret-handshake](https://github.com/dominictarr/secret-handshake)
to encrypt connections between any two instances, this protects the
privacy of not only the content, but also your _connection metadata_.
How the metadata is protected is explained in depth in the
[secret-handshake paper](https://dominictarr.github.io/secret-handshake-paper/shs.pdf)

All cryptography in SecureScuttlebutt comes from the [libsodium](https://download.libsodium.org/doc/) library.

## Spam, Abuse, and Moderation

Spam is a fundamental problem any network design.
Email is famously vulnerable to spam.
To send someone an email, all that is required is to have their address.
Unsoliced messaging is the default mode, and then spam must be filtered
out using clever methods based on analyzing the content of the messages
and history of the sending address, (greatly complicating an otherwise
simple protocol). On the other hand, SecureScuttlebutt does not support
unsolicited messaging, instead using an explicit "follow" mechanism,
to opt into logs to receive. We call this "Solicited Spam."

This simple mechanism means most spam is not possible.

If someone posts offensive content or abuse, that content can be flagged
by peers, or that user can be blocked. If you block another feed,
your peers will refuse to give your data to the blocked peer.

Since SecureScuttlebutt is decentralized, it is not possible to have
centralized moderators, instead our strategy is to put moderation tools
into the hand of every user.

Each secure-scuttlebutt community decides what behavior is acceptable within it.
